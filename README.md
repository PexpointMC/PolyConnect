# PolyConnect
PolyConnect is a Polytoria + ROBLOX Connecting game where you can play on both ROBLOX and Polytoria sides, just like Minecraft and ROBLOX crossplay games!

## Understanding the Basics.

PolyConnect is not that hard to understand. All you have to do is put some Scripts into your games on both ends, and create a server URL (sadly, you can't use our 30 player servers because they are locked to 5 slots for our game. don't leak your server URL as someone can steal it and use it for their servers. always add a secret key.), and put it into your scripts, and you are done. That's not "all", but thats just the basics.
